# MAE563
Coursework and files for MAE563: Instabilities in Fluids

Problem sets and analyses include the Rayleigh - Taylor Instability, Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, and the Benjamin-Feir instability.

Each instability has two parts. The first is some sort of stability analysis and/or derivation. The second is a numerical simulation, using code written by L. Deike at Princeton University using the program Basilisk.
