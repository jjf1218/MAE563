# MAE563
Coursework and files for MAE563: Instabilities in Fluids

Problem sets and analyses include the Rayleigh - Taylor Instability, Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, and more to come.

Each instability has two parts. The first is the linear stability analysis, using the method of normal mode. The second is a numerical simulation, using code written by L. Deike at Princeton University using the program Basilisk.
